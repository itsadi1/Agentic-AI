# Agentic AI Systems

## Overview
This is a centralized repository for developing, organising, and scaling autonomous AI agents. This project focuses on modular, decision-driven architectures to enable robust agentic systems. It includes implementations of low-level functional agents, centralized control logic, multi-agent coordination protocols, and advanced integration patterns like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool-augmented reasoning.

#### Attributes:
- Low-Level Functional Agents: Modular components for task-specific agent functionalities.<br>
- Centralized Control Logic: Lead management for core decision-making and workflows.<br>
  ##### Additional Integration:<br>
  - RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for enhanced context-aware responses.<br>
  - Tools: Integration with external tools like WatsonAI.

Purpose
This repository promotes innovation in autonomous agent architectures by providing a space for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to construct and analyze scalable agentic AI systems.
